# Google POI data download
This code downloads the latitude and longitude of different google point of interests (Restaurant, Market etc) as you choose. 

A sample input data is attached to this repository. Or if you have few inputs, you can manually insert the latitude and longitude. I haven't figure out why, but I called for free data only, but paid data for places API are getting pulled simultaneously, so turn on your necessary safeguards suggested by google API before using this code.
